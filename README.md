### my first python code on github <br />
> Python is simple language in nature. Easy to learn and understand. Free and Open Source. Python is Interpreted, Interactive, Dynamic, Functional, Hightly readable Language.
> Python is a high-level and widely used programming language.<br/>It is very popular and used by Google, Intel, IBM, NASA, Pixar, Netflix, Facebook, JP Morgan Chase, Spotify,the CIA, and Disney.

*print statement can also be used to output multiple lines each print statement outputs text from a newline.* <br>
* print('hello world')<br />
``` hello world ```
* print("hello everyone")<br />
``` hello everyone ``` <br/>                 
***simple operations*** <br/>
  **____________________** <br/>
  Do all the operations _left-to-right_<br/>*use ***pemdas*** p-parenthesis, e-exponentiation, m&d m-mutiplication, d-division, a&s a-addition, s-subtraction or else <br/>***bodmas*** b-brackets, o-orders(i.e powers & square root etc), dm-division & multiplication, as-addition & subtraction (both pemdas and bodmas are same)* <br/>
 **Floats** <br/>
 *Floats are used in python to represents numbers.<br/>they can be created directly by entering a number with decimal point.<br/>ex:0.3 and 2.345*
* print(2+2)<br />
 ``` 4.0 ``` <br/>
* print(2+2-1)<br />
``` 3.0 ``` <br/> 
**Multiplication** <br/>
**________________**
* print(2*(2+1))<br />
``` 6.0 ``` <br/>
**Division** <br/>
**_________**
* print(2/2)<br />
``` 1.0 ``` <br/>
* print(1/2)<br />
``` 0.5 ``` <br/>
**Exponentiation** <br/>
**________________**
* print(2**3)<br />
``` 8 ``` <br/>
* print(9**(1/2))<br />
``` 3.0 ``` *note: number (1/2) means (âˆš)* <br/>
**Quotient** <br/>
**__________**
* print(25//6)<br />
``` 4 ``` <br/> 
**Remainder** <br/>
**____________**
* print(25%6)<br />
``` 1 ``` <br/>
* print(8%(3//2))<br />
``` 8 ```
